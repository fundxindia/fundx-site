  <h1>FundX – Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025‑01‑01</p>

  <p>
    FundX is a personal technology prototype owned and operated by 《☆》 and used only
    for internal testing, training and product experiments. FundX is <strong>not</strong>
    a bank, NBFC or regulated financial institution. Any “wallet balance”, “loans”,
    “interest” or “limits” shown inside the apps represent simulated records for
    product‑design purposes only.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Use of the app</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Access to the app is provided only to a limited group of internal users.</li>
    <li>You agree not to treat any on‑screen balance or loan as real money or
        legally enforceable obligation.</li>
    <li>You will not use FundX to collect or manage real customer funds.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. No financial services</h2>
  <p>
    FundX does not issue real loans, credit lines or payment instruments. The app
    is a closed prototype connected to a test Supabase database. No bank transfer,
    UPI payment or card transaction is triggered by using this app.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data &amp; privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Basic profile data (name, email, phone, device information and optional KYC
    photos) is stored securely on Supabase. This data is used only for internal
    testing and is not sold to third‑party advertisers. For more details refer to
    the FundX Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>
    Because FundX is a prototype, it may contain bugs or be unavailable at times.
    《☆》 will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from use of this demo,
    including loss of data or business interruption.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Changes to these terms</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms &amp; Conditions may be updated from time to time. Continued use of
    the prototype after changes means you accept the updated terms.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
